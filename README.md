# KMines Classic Dark Theme

## Description

A dark KMines theme based on the classic theme shipped with KMines.

KMines is a great minesweeper game but it does not ship any dark theme, which causes a lot of eye sores using a dark global theme. So I created this dark theme by editing the shipped Classic theme using Inkscape.

## Installation

Run script `install.sh` to install the theme for yourself.

Or if you want to do the installation manually:

- To install for yourself, put all files under `~/.config/share/kmines/themes` (create the directory if it does not exist).

- To install for all users, put all files under `/usr/share/kmines/themes` (root privilege required).
